# Travel Agency Backend

## D288 â€“ BACK-END PROGRAMMING

This university project was an opportunity for me to develop object-oriented applications that can be integrated with relational databases, write code for object-oriented applications using Spring framework, and implements design patterns for object-oriented applications. 

Through it, I was able to:

* Design an entire fully-functioning ecommerce Spring Boot back end according to UML specifications
* Develop customer cart, checkout service, and order tracking features to fulfill travel excursion orders
* Incorporate MVC framework using REST API, complete with validation and sample customer data

## BASIC INSTRUCTIONS

`git clone https://github.com/saksben/d288-back-end-programming.git`

Run the program to start up the back end

Open the program in a terminal and navigate to `frontend/"D288 Front End"`

Enter the command `ng serve` to start up the front end

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to access the application

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/api` to access the back end
